qvct (1.0.20131121) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * NEW RELEASE (see https://github.com/cedric-dufour/qvct for detailed changelog) 
  - FIX: Perform dynamic flotilla cleanup more elegantly (previous method
         was calling the cleanup code way too often)
  - NEW: SBS-1 (ADS-B) base station (device) support
  - FIX: Device status (start/pause/stop) would sometimes be reported
         erroneously.
  - NEW: Dynamic flotilla are now automatically clean-up after
         user-specified "time-to-live" timeout is reached.
  - FIX: Do not use position to compute course for devices that provide
         course data (but not necessarily in the same time as position
         data)
  - FIX: Return the correct driver and capabilities for GPSD_AIS devices.
  - FIX: Do not look for potentially duplicate name(s) when importing
         items from file (as it leads to 100% CPU and slow import for
         large files, like GPX tracks).
  - FIX: Allow 'cmake' to look for and include Qt dependencies more elegantly
