  * NEW RELEASE (see https://github.com/cedric-dufour/qvct for detailed changelog)
  - NEW: Added FAQ entry about supported file formats
  - FIX: Do not include target point when copying pointer path to landmarks or
         route
  - NEW: Added target point designation (and routing line from current
         position-synchronizing vessel)
  - MOD: Consolidated chart redraw (update) calls, so that chart redraw (update)
         is triggered on the UI (user interface/interaction) edge rather than in
         "setters" methods.

  - MOD: Improved visibility handling and text placement of overlays objects
  - FIX: Prevent potential null-pointer usage when synchronizing vessel point
         position
  - NEW: Pinch-zoom (multitouch) gesture for chanching chart scale
         WARNING: Due to bugs in the evdev/Qt stack, this leads to unresponsive
         interface on evdev-backed multitouch devices (touchscreens)!
         This feature in thus disabled by default in the application settings.
  - MOD: Use (NEW) internal 'microtime' function wherever it's sensible
  - ADD: Retrieve microsecond-precision system time in a sensible way
  - ADD: Allow devices to have their error messages appear in the main window's

  - ADD: Unified warning and error messages (dialogs)
  - FIX: Do not keep out-of-date fix data when device does not feed any data
         (e.g. when no more GPS coverage)
